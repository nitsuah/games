# Games Collection

A collection of 3D web games built with Next.js, Three.js, and React Three Fiber.

## Asteroid

A fast-paced 3D space shooter where you pilot a spaceship through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions and destroying targets. Built with Three.js and React Three Fiber, the game offers immersive gameplay with dynamic environments and challenging mechanics.

### How to Play

- Use **WASD** to move forward/backward and strafe left/right.
- Use **Space** to thrust up and **Shift** to thrust down.
- Use the **Mouse** to aim and click to shoot.
- Avoid colliding with asteroids to preserve health.
- Destroy all asteroids to win, or survive as long as possible.

### Features

- **3D Asteroid Field**: Randomly moving asteroids in a bounded 3D space, creating a dynamic and unpredictable environment.
- **Full 6-Degrees-of-Freedom Movement**: Move in all directions with smooth, physics-based controls.
- **Physics-Based Ship Controls**: Realistic inertia and thrust mechanics for immersive gameplay.
- **Mouse-Look Controls**: Pointer lock for precise aiming and navigation.
- **Dynamic Scoring System**:
  - Earn 100 points per target hit.
  - Accuracy multiplier boosts your score based on precision.
